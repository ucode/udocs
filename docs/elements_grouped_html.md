## HTML5 Elements: Page Structure
An HTML element is defined by a starting tag. If the element contains other content, it ends with a closing tag. A Web page has structure and the HTML provides this. The CSS styles the page. 

Start with `<!DOCTYPE html>`
---------
The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration should be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the `<html>` tag. It's not an HTML tag; it's an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. Keep away "Quirks Mode."

Main root
---------

| Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`<html>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html "The HTML <html> element represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the root element. All other elements must be descendants of this element.") | The **HTML `<html>` element** represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also called the *root element*. All other elements are descendants of this element. |

Document metadata (the `<head>` tag)
-----------------

The `<head> tag holds metadata which is information about the page. This includes information about styles, scripts and data to help software ([search engines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/search_engine "search engines: A search engine is a software system that collects information from the World Wide Web and presents it to users who are looking for specific information."), [browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Browser "browsers: A Web browser is a program that retrieves and displays pages from the Web, and lets users access further pages through hyperlinks."), etc.) use and render the page. Metadata for styles and scripts may be defined in the page or link to another file that has the information. Things in this element don't render in the browser.

| Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`<link>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link "The HTML <link> element specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource.  This element is most used to link to style sheets.") | The **HTML `<link>` element** sets up external resources like CSS stylesheets and script files.  |
| [`<meta>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta "The HTML <meta> element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like <base>, <link>, <script>, <style> or <title>.") | The **HTML `<meta>` element** represents [metadata](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Metadata "metadata: Metadata is --- in its very simplest definition --- data that describes data. For example, an HTML document is data, but HTML can also contain metadata in its <head> element that describes the document --- for example who wrote it, and its summary.") - which is information about data! Use `<meta charset="UTF-8">` so your text renders like it is supposed to. You can use `<meta name="Your name">` to say who made your website! Use `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` to make sure the browser checks to see what size the viewer's screen is. Plus there is a lot more you can do with the [`<meta>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta "The HTML <meta> element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like <base>, <link>, <script>, <style> or <title>.") tag.|
| [`<style>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style "The HTML <style> element contains style information for a document, or part of a document.") | The **HTML `<style>` element** contains style information for a document, or part of a document. |
| [`<title>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title "The HTML Title element (<title>) defines the title of the document, shown in a browser's title bar or on the page's tab.") | The **HTML Title element** (**`<title>`**) defines the title of the document, shown in a browser's title bar or on the page's tab. |

Then the `<body>`
---------------

| Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`<body>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body "The HTML <body> Element represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one <body> element in a document.") | The **HTML `<body>` Element** represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one `<body>` element in a document. |

Content sectioning
------------------

Content sectioning elements allow you to organize the document content into logical pieces. Use the sectioning elements to create a broad outline for your page content, including header and footer navigation, and heading elements to identify sections of content.  Here it is good to use **semantic** tags which describe the information in a meaningful way.  

| Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`<article>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article "The HTML <article> element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry.") | The **HTML `<article>` element** represents a self-contained composition in a webpage. It's like the `<figure>` tag but for text! This means that the text or article will make sense on its own. Example:  posting some different reviews about a game you feature on your website. Put those each in an `<article>` tag. Articles can contain `<section>`'s and `<h1>`'s. They are like little mini pages within a page. |
| [`<aside>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside "The HTML <aside> element represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content.") | The **HTML `<aside>` element** represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content. |

It has no effect on the content or layout until styled using CSS.") | The **HTML Content Division element** (**`<div>`**) is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled using CSS. |
| [`<footer>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer "The HTML <footer> element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element. A footer typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.") | The** HTML `<footer>` element** represents a footer for its nearest [sectioning content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Sections_and_Outlines_of_an_HTML5_document#Defining_Sections_in_HTML5) or [sectioning root](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Sections_and_Outlines_of_an_HTML5_document#Sectioning_root "Sections and Outlines of an HTML5 document#Sectioning root") element.

| [`<header>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header "The HTML <header> element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids.

There can be only one <body> element in a document.") and closing `</body>` tags.
